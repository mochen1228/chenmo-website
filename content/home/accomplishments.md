  I worked for the Big Data Team under Xiaomi Cloud Division as a Software Engineering Intern. During my 9 weeks at Xiaomi, I assited my team on processing and analyzing user activity data for 240+ million monthly active Xiaomi smartphone users, such as application usage data, user behavior data and advertisement exposure data.

  Some of my key contributions were:
  * Utilized user profiles and activities to run Spark jobs that generate advertising targets for Xiaomi app store publishers
  * Collaborated with the advertising and business department to fit advertisement deploying schedules
  * Increased the advertisement view/click rates by up to 15% for several big-name applications

  <br/>During my internship, I used various Big Data technologies/tools such as Spark, Hadoop, SQL and Hive. My code was mainly written in Scala.
