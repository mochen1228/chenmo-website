I am an graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Networks and Mobility. I went to UC Irvine for my undergrad, where I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In the past few years, I have studied and practiced various domains in Computer Science, such as Mobile Development, Web Development, Database Management, Big Data and Machine Learining. 

In Summer 2020, I will be joining Hulu as a Software Engineering Intern to work on DevOps on the networks team.
